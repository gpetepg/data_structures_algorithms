My notes and resources while studying data structures and algorithms.

I'll be adding better notes and hopefully pseudo code for every algorithm.

If GitHub doesn't render the notebook use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. I will eventually just set up README's with links in each directory of type of algorithm.
