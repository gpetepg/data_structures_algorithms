# Data structures and algorithms.

Will be adding better notes and hopefully pseudo code for every algorithm.

https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Heap.html Useful visualization tool.

If GitHub doesn't render the notebook use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. I will eventually just set up README's with links in each directory of type of algorithm.
